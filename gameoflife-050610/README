Game of Life Kata
-----------------

This is the code I've written while doing the Game of Life kata (http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataGameOfLife) at XP2010 after missing Emily Bache's (http://emilybache.blogspot.com/) coding dojo.
As you will notice, my Clojure fu leaves a lot to be desired, so feel invited to leave comments and feedback. Also have a look at the other two implementations.

Notes
-----

This was my third attempt at this kata in Clojure. I find it to be the most legible. Please let me know what you think.
